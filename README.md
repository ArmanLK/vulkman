First I'm trying out [vulkan-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).
Then probably creating my own rendering engine.

I'm using zig build system instead of Cmake.

# The Triangle Demo
```bash
zig build triangle
```

# The Rectangle Demo
```bash
zig build rectangle
```

# The 3D Rectangle Demo
```bash
zig build rectangle_3d
```
unfortunately I couldn't capture a video of this thing rotating (at least for now).
